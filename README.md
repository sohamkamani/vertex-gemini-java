# Using the Vertex (Google Cloud) Gemini API in Java

This is the example repo for my blog post on [Using the Vertex (Google Cloud) Gemini API in Java](https://sohamkamani.com/java/gemini-vertex-api)

To run this example:

1. Make sure you have Java, JDK, and Maven installed
2. Clone the repo
3. Run `mvn clean compile assembly:single` - this should give you a JAR file in the `target` folder
4. Run `java -jar target/vertex-gemini-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` to run the JAR file
